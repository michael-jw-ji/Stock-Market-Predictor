Overview
The Stock Market Predictor is a Jupyter Notebook project that leverages machine learning techniques to forecast stock market trends. By analyzing historical stock data, the model aims to provide insights into potential future stock performance.​

Features
Data Analysis: Processes and visualizes historical stock data to identify patterns and trends.​

Predictive Modeling: Implements machine learning algorithms to predict future stock prices based on historical data.​
